# udi-Blink
Blink Node Server for IoP/ISY
The node is primarily targeted at arming and disarming cameras, but allows snapping a picture (Furutre will add ability to have the picture emailed automatically to the user account)

# Setup
User needs provide username and password used for the Blink App.  A one time authndication may also be needed.
Furthermore the user must specify the sync unit(s) where the cameras are registered - A comman separated list is ok if more than 1 sync unit is being used.  If not sync unit is used specify NONE
